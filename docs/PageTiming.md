## Example

```python
from dataforseo_client.models.page_timing import PageTiming

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PageTiming from a JSON string
page_timing_instance = PageTiming.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PageTiming.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
page_timing_dict = page_timing_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PageTiming from a dict
page_timing_from_dict = PageTiming.from_dict(page_timing_dict)
