**pages** | **Dict[str, Optional[str]]** | target URLs of pages required field you can set up to 20 pages in this object the pages should be specified with absolute URLs (including http:// or https://) example: \&quot;pages\&quot;: { \&quot;1\&quot;:\&quot;https://www.apple.com/mac/*\&quot;, \&quot;2\&quot;:\&quot;https://dataforseo.com/*\&quot;, \&quot;3\&quot;:\&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/\&quot; }if you specify a single page here, we will return results only for this page; you can also use a wildcard (‘*’) character to specify the search pattern example: \&quot;example.com\&quot; search for the exact URL \&quot;example.com/eng/*\&quot; search for the example.com page and all its related URLs which start with ‘/eng/’, such as “example.com/eng/index.html” and “example.com/eng/help/”, etc. note: a wilcard should be placed after the slash (‘/’) character in the end of the URL, it is not possible to place it after the domain in the following way: https://dataforseo.com* use https://dataforseo.com/* instead Note: this endpoint will not provide results if the number of intersecting keywords exceeds 10 million | [optional] 
**exclude_pages** | **List[str]** | URLs of pages you want to exclude optional field you can set up to 10 pages in this array if you use this array, results will contain the keywords for which URLs from the pages object rank, but URLs from exclude_pages array do not; note that if you specify this field, the results will be based on the keywords any URL from pages ranks for regardless of intersections between them. However, you can set intersection_mode to intersect and results will contain the keywords all URLs from pages rank for in the same SERP and URLs from exclude_pages do not. use a wildcard (‘*’) character to specify the search pattern example: \&quot;exclude_pages\&quot;: [ \&quot;https://www.apple.com/iphone/*\&quot;, \&quot;https://dataforseo.com/apis/*\&quot;, \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/services/\&quot; ] | [optional]

**item_types** | **List[str]** | search results type indicates type of search results included in the response optional field possible values: [\&quot;organic\&quot;, \&quot;paid\&quot;, \&quot;featured_snippet\&quot;, \&quot;local_pack\&quot;] default value: [\&quot;organic\&quot;, \&quot;paid\&quot;, \&quot;featured_snippet\&quot;, \&quot;local_pack\&quot;] | [optional]

**intersection_mode** | **str** | indicates whether to intersect keywords optional field use this field to intersect or merge results for the specified URLs possible values: union, intersect union – results are based on all keywords any URL from pages rank for; intersect – results are based on the keywords all URLs from pages rank for in the same SERP: by default, results are based on the intersect mode if you specify only pages array. If you specify exclude_pages as well, results are based on the union mode | [optional] 
**include_serp_info** | **bool** | include data from SERP for each keyword optional field if set to true, we will return a serp_info array containing SERP data (number of search results, relevant URL, and SERP features) for every keyword in the response default value: false | [optional] 
**filters** | **List[Optional[object]]** | array of results filtering parameters optional field you can add several filters at once (8 filters maximum) you should set a logical operator and, or between the conditions the following operators are supported: regex, not_regex, &lt;, &lt;&#x3D;, &gt;, &gt;&#x3D;, &#x3D;, &lt;&gt;, in, not_in, ilike, not_ilike, like, not_like you can use the % operator with like and not_like, as well as ilike and not_ilike to match any string of zero or more characters note that if you want to filter by any field in the intersection_result array you need to specify the number of corresponding page for instance, if you want to filter results by the ranking of the first specified URL, you should set the following filter: [intersection_result.1.rank_absolute,\&quot;&#x3D;\&quot;,1] if you want to filter results and receive only organic listings for the third specified URL, you should set the following filter: [intersection_result.3.type,\&quot;&#x3D;\&quot;,\&quot;organic\&quot;] , etc.example: [\&quot;keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume\&quot;,\&quot;in\&quot;,[100,1000]] [[\&quot;intersection_result.1.etv\&quot;,\&quot;&gt;\&quot;,0],\&quot;and\&quot;,[\&quot;intersection_result.1.description\&quot;,\&quot;like\&quot;,\&quot;%goat%\&quot;]][[\&quot;keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume\&quot;,\&quot;&gt;\&quot;,100], \&quot;and\&quot;, [[\&quot;intersection_result.2.description\&quot;,\&quot;like\&quot;,\&quot;%goat%\&quot;], \&quot;or\&quot;, [\&quot;intersection_result.2.type\&quot;,\&quot;&#x3D;\&quot;,\&quot;organic\&quot;]]] for more information about filters, please refer to Dataforseo Labs – Filters or this help center guide | [optional]

**tag** | **str** | user-defined task identifier optional field the character limit is 255 you can use this parameter to identify the task and match it with the result you will find the specified tag value in the data object of the response | [optional]

```python
from dataforseo_client.models.dataforseo_labs_bing_page_intersection_live_request_info import DataforseoLabsBingPageIntersectionLiveRequestInfo

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DataforseoLabsBingPageIntersectionLiveRequestInfo from a JSON string
dataforseo_labs_bing_page_intersection_live_request_info_instance = DataforseoLabsBingPageIntersectionLiveRequestInfo.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(DataforseoLabsBingPageIntersectionLiveRequestInfo.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
dataforseo_labs_bing_page_intersection_live_request_info_dict = dataforseo_labs_bing_page_intersection_live_request_info_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DataforseoLabsBingPageIntersectionLiveRequestInfo from a dict
dataforseo_labs_bing_page_intersection_live_request_info_from_dict = DataforseoLabsBingPageIntersectionLiveRequestInfo.from_dict(dataforseo_labs_bing_page_intersection_live_request_info_dict)
